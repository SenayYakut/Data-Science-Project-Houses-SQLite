* Implement a program to import student data into a database, and then produce class rosters.
* In import.py, write a program that imports data from a CSV spreadsheet then imports data into a database.
    * If the incorrect number of command-line arguments are provided, your program should print an       error and exit.
    * For each student in the CSV file, insert the student into the students table in the               students.db database.
    * While the CSV file provided to you has just a name column, the database has separate              columns for first, middle, and last names
    
* write a program that prints a list of students for a given house in alphabetical order.
